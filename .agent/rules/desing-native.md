For the variety of design tasks you perform, prefer to use Tailwind CSS v4, using a design with rounded and perfect blue borders. Always ensure that the design is 100% responsive and adaptable. It must be very responsive for designs on macOS. Use the native menu bar by default, which has stable and well-defined functionalities in RUST to avoid future errors. For Windows and Linux, use a component that is the menu bar for those well-designed platforms with blur.
